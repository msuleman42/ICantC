# RollSafe

Women's safety is a major concern in many countries, yet there are few services accessible to make people feel safer. Studies show 20% of women and 4% of men have experienced the act of sexually assault or rape (Statistics - Sexual Violence, 2019), there aren't enough tools to address this immediate crisis. Our project's main goal is to help reduce this figure, or at the very least to contribute in some capacity. Given the prevalence of technology in everyday life, what better approach combat sexual assault and rape than to integrate this solution into the technology itself? This is a clear gap in the mobile application market.

To bridge this gap, Team I Canâ€™t C created RollSafe. An android mobile application that allows women to feel comfortable knowing that if anything unexpected happens on their journey, they have a solution that can help keep them safe. The basis of the application is if the user deviates from their pre-programmed path or manually triggers the alert, a loud alarm will sound on their device deterring possible a possible attack and alerting others in the area to their distress, and their current location will be immediately sent to their emergency contact.

For this hackathon, due to the given time frame, we narrowed this challenge down to a more focused project, with a more attainable implementation. Which upon success of this project, can be expanded in the future. This particular implementation of RollSafe will focus on instances in which people aim to travel to a specific destination and are assaulted along the route. Expansion for this project will include an IOS implementation, as well as the use of internal sensors to detect physical assault instead of solely relying on path deviation and manual triggering of the alarm system.
